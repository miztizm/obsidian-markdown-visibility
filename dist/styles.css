/*
 * Markdown Visibility Plugin Styles
 *
 * This file is intentionally empty because all CSS is dynamically injected
 * by the plugin's TypeScript code (src/main.ts). This allows the plugin to
 * toggle marker visibility on/off without requiring Obsidian restarts.
 *
 * DO NOT add CSS rules here - they will persist even when the plugin is disabled!
